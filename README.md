# Game-Of-Life

This is a graphic representation of Conway's game of life. There is a grid with empty cells to start. Clicking on a cell will turn it "alive". The relative age of cells is shown in a change of color from green for youngest to red for oldest. There are buttons to start, pause, reset, go back a step, and go forward a step. There is also a drop down menu for pre-created set pieces for the simulation to run. To run the simulation compile and run the LifeSimulation.java file.
